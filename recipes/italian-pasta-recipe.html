        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Arguably the most well-known of the Roman pastas, cacio e pepe is the foundation of all the subsequent dishes. Like many Italian dishes, cacio e pepe is made from just a few simple ingredients. Cacio loosely translates to "cheese;" more specifically, a sheep's milk cheese — but Pecorino-Romano and Parmesan are still considered traditional to use. Pepe is Italian for "pepper." Needless to say, you're working with some pretty simple ingredients here — the technique is the complex part.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients-styling">
            <li>8 ounces dried pasta</li>
            <li>1 ounce Parmesan cheese (plus more for serving), grated</li>
            <li>1 ounce Pecorino-Romano cheese, grated</li>
            <li>Freshly cracked black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class="steps-styling">
            <li> Boil pasta in a pot of heavily salted water for about 2 minutes less than the package directions recommend.</li>
            <li>Preheat a large skillet over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>In a small mixing bowl, add both cheeses, a generous amount of black pepper, and a splash of cold water; mix vigorously to form a paste.</li>
            <li>Drain pasta, reserving about 2 cups of pasta water.</li>
            <li>Add about 1 cup of pasta water to the skillet; add in the drained pasta and toss. Dollop the cheese paste around in the pan. Mix vigorously to create a smooth sauce, adding in more pasta water as needed to achieve desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Taste, adjust seasoning as desired, and serve topped with more Parmesan and more black pepper.</li>
        </ol>
