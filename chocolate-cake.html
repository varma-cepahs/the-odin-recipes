        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p class="p-style">
            I've made this recipe dozens of times over the last 10-15 years and every time I serve it, everyone always says it's the best chocolate cake they've ever had. It's extremely moist and dense, about as close as you can get to a brownie while still calling it cake. It's super easy to make. Everytime I have any other chocolate cake, it disappoints compared to this.
